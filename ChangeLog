	* New TS option for class.tx_tipafriend.php, method tipform(): Added a TS constant useCaptcha and a corresponding TS configuration useCaptcha which defaults to 1 for backwards compatibility. It is now possible to turn off the captcha feature. Thanks to Ingo Schmitt <is@marketing-factory.de> for providing a first patch.

	* Security fixes: added the function validateUrl() to prevent cross-site-scripting. The function removes all html-tags from the tipUrl parameter and it checks for '"' (doublequote) in tipUrl. Additionally it checks if the given tipUrl belongs to the server to prevent sending urls of foreign servers.
